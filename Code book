This code book explains what has been done to the raw data to merge train and test data from the assignment of the coursera course: "Getting and Cleaning Data", week 4.
The tidy data set is store in the file "tidy_data.txt". It contains 81 variables and 180 observations.
The first variable is the only one to be a factor. The others are all numeric.
To obtain this data set, the raw dat from two data set (train and test) have been merged. The columns with mean and stadard deviation (SD) have been extracted.
The same transformations have been made for the test data set and then for the train data set.
A subject has been assigned to the file X_test/train. The columns names have been assigned. The different activities have been assigned a name to the file y_test/train.
The data have been bonded to creat a single file for train and a single file for test.
Train data and set data have been merged and labels added to abtain the final tidy data set "melt_data".
Mean have been calculated for each variable and a new tidy file have been created "tidy_data.txt".
The variables are summarized here:
